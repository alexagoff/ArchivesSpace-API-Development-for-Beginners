# ArchivesSpace API Development for Beginners
This repository includes resources used for the mini-workshop “Have you tried the API?: ArchivesSpace API Development for Beginners” presented in May 2023 at the Northwest Archivists Annual Meeting.  

You'll find a small set of utility JSON scripts to be used with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), a GUI for API development, in the subfolder [Postman Collections](Postman%20Collections). Combined with the hands-on demonstration, these Postman Collections and support documentation should help users gain a basic understanding and use of the [ArchivesSpace API](https://archivesspace.github.io/archivesspace/api/) to extract data or make changes to their collection metadata at their home institutions.
